YouTube-Chrome-PlayList
=======================

Download from: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-playlist/oldagkdddpneeopaofiflfdidknmhgbb

This is an Chrome Extension which lets you:

1. Search for Youtube videos without opening the YouTube page.
2. Build a play queue: add searched videos OR right click on any Youtube link
3. Save, Delete, Update your YouTube playlists.


Major Bug remaining:
The save to youtube API does not let you add multiple videos to the playlist.
